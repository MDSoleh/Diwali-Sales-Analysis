Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Advanced Analysis

Reporting and Visualization

## Install Libraries:

 - !pip install numpy                          
 - !pip install pandas                        
 - !pip install seaborn


## Steps involved before EDA:
*1.Collect data:Here from a csv file.*
*2.Reading csv file.*
